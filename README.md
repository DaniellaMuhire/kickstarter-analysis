# kickstarter with Excel
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends


## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to help Louise know how the various campaigns have evolved in relation to their launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May. The month of May and June both have greater success rate. However, we can see that January, June, July and October have roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched. This is determined by examining the points along the trend lines of the chart.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
In general, we can see that when the goal range is small, the percentage Successful is higher and the percentage Failed is smaller, and when the goal range is higher, the percentage Successful is smaller and the percentage Failed is higher. The percentage Canceled remains null in those two scenarios. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Challenges and difficulties encountered were mostly how to manipulate Excel. For the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date sheet for example, it was hard for me to figure out what to put in the rows or fiels. I had to make sure that I understand the given question. This other difficult part was converting in percentages. I was getting weird numbers. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Based on the trend lines, we can first conclude that it is better to launch campaign in the months of May and June  absed on the line chart results. Secondly, the length of a campaign is correlated with its success. A longer campaign has more chnace of being successful. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Baes on goals,  we can conclude that more the goal is higher, more likely it won't be successful and vice versa.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Some limitations could be a limited sample size or lack of reliable data such as self-reported data, missing data, and deficiencies in data measurements. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

It would be great to have a graphs of potential outliers Outcomes based on Launch Date and Goals. It would also be great to use skewness to wuantify how skewed, or asymmetrical, a distribution is.
